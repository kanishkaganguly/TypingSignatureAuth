# TypingSignatureAuth
Typing Signature Based Authentication

An experiment in trying to create an authentication system based on typing signatures of the user.
Each user has a different rate of typing which is unique to him, which can be used to recognize and authenticate said user.
Basic features for recognition include average time to type the sentence, the time between words and the average keypress times.

This is by no means perfect, just a trial run on the future of passwords and authentication.
